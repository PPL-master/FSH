### Background

This Implementation Guide is built to convey examples - it is not a substitute for the EMA implementation guide for IDMP

### Working Examples

The Artifacts tab of this guide provides a set of examples for different products.  To accompany these there is a FHIR server that has been loaded with the same set of examples.  Direct access to the server uses the following address:

https://ppl.azurewebsites.net/ppl02

**Note**: Following this link directly will generate a download, not take you to a webpage.  

At present there are no access restrictions for this server.

As an alternative the same server can be access through an API manager which provides example calls to the FHIR server that actually read and write some of the examples to the server.  This can be accessed here:

[https://ppl.developer.azure-api.net](https://ppl.developer.azure-api.net)

This API manager also provides sample code in several languages for using the calls to the server.  This can be a significant help when writing applications.
